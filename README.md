# UnzipsTons
This Python application will unzip all .zip files in a folder, and unzip them to a destination of your choosing.

This is a simple little application that I wrote quickly because I wanted to unzip a bunch of game files from one folder and put the contents of all zip files into a completely different directory, on a different hard drive. 

This was helpful for me on a couple of occasions, so making this public. 

It is very rudimentary: you have to edit the source in order to change the source/destination folders. This is an intentional choice as this has no error handling whatsoever. 

In order to run the program, enter into a python terminal of your choosing, and manually type "UnzipsTons.py" to run the program.
